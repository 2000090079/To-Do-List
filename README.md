# To-Do-List
A simple, interactive To-Do List web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as complete, making it easy to manage daily tasks. The app stores the user's tasks in the browser's local storage, so the list persists even after refreshing the page.
